🚗 Just Launched a New Client Website! 🌐
I'm excited to share a project I recently completed for a client: Navkar Tours & Travels — a trusted car rental service based in Gujarat.

📌 Project Overview:
A fully responsive and SEO-optimized React website showcasing:

🚙 Complete fleet of cars with seat-wise filtering

📞 One-click direct call & WhatsApp chat options

🧑‍💼 Owner profile and achievements

🏠 Animated sections for Home, About, Contact & Feedback

🌙 Light/Dark Theme toggle for enhanced user experience

📍 Integrated business address with map-ready format

🔗 Live Website:

💻 Built using:

React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion for animations

Vercel for fast deployment

Big thanks to the client for trusting me with this project 🙌
Looking forward to building more impactful digital solutions.
